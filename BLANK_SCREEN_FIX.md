# Quick Fix Summary

## Problem: Blank Screen After NixOS Installation on Proxmox VM

### What was wrong:
The NixOS configuration was missing essential graphical components:
- No X11 server enabled
- No display manager (GDM/LightDM)  
- No desktop environment or window manager
- Missing VM-specific graphics drivers

### What was fixed:
1. **Added X11 server**: `services.xserver.enable = true`
2. **Added display manager**: `displayManager.gdm.enable = true`
3. **Added desktop environment**: `desktopManager.gnome.enable = true`
4. **Added VM graphics drivers**: `videoDrivers = [ "qxl" "virtio" "cirrus" "vesa" ]`
5. **Added VM integration**: `qemuGuest.enable = true` + `spice-vdagentd.enable = true`

### To apply the fix:
1. Update your NixOS configuration with the changes from `hosts/nixos/default.nix`
2. Rebuild and switch: `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`
3. Reboot the VM
4. You should now see the GNOME login screen instead of a blank screen

### If you still have issues:
- Check the Proxmox console type (try VNC, SPICE, etc.)
- Verify VM has sufficient RAM (4GB+ recommended for GNOME)
- Check system logs: `journalctl -xeu gdm`
- See full troubleshooting guide in `docs/PROXMOX_VM_SETUP.md`

The key insight is that NixOS requires explicit configuration of the graphical stack - it doesn't assume you want a desktop environment by default.
